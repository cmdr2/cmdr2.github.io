# Freebird v1 released!

Freebird allows you to use a VR headset with Blender, to create and edit content inside regular Blender. 

[Get started with Freebird!](https://freebirdxr.com/getting-started/){ .md-button }

## Major features
- **Start VR button inside Blender** - Switch to VR editing (and back) seamlessly using an easy `Start VR` button inside Blender.
- **Select Tool** - Select and move/rotate/scale objects intuitively in 3D using the VR controllers. You can also select and move vertices/edges/faces in EDIT mode. Keep the trigger on the alternate hand pressed to toggle the selection (i.e. unselect existing selections, or add items to existing selections). You can also click outside all the objects and drag through multiple objects to select them.
- **Pen Tool** - Draw lines in 3D using the VR controller. This draws NURBS curves, which you can edit. Use `Pipe` to make fat pipes, and the `Straight line` option to draw a straight line/pipe.
- **Shape Tool** - Draw primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, torus, monkey) using the VR controller.
- **Hull Tool** - Draw volumes quickly using the VR controller. This is very helpful for expressing shape ideas quickly with rough volumes.
- **Erase Tool** - Erase objects using the VR controller.
- **Clone Tool** - Clone selected objects, and use 1-click clone for quickly creating lots of clones in different locations around the scene.
- **Edit Mode** - Move vertices/edges/faces in the EDIT mode.
- **Bevel/Inset/Extrude** - Edit mesh vertices/edges/faces by beveling or insetting or extruding them.
- **Quicktools** - Press the `Quicktools` button on your main controller, and move left or right to quickly switch between the `Erase` and `Select` tool. This helps you stay in the creative flow, without needing to look at the menu each time.
- **Hand preference** - Choose Left-Handed or Right-Handed, and the UI will adjust to suit your hand preference better.
- **Mirror** - Display in Blender's desktop view what you're seeing inside VR. This is useful when you're communicating your idea with someone.
- **Sync with viewport** - Use the keyboard and mouse to control the VR camera, and vice-versa also use the VR controllers to control the desktop view.
