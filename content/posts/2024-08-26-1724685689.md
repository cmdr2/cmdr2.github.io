Got !FS working in the browser using `PyScript`! It's pretty cool - `python`, `skyfield`, `numpy` etc running inside the browser, fully client-side. And I didn't have to modify the code, it just works. And most importantly, it performed pretty decently. Acceptable performance.

The performance on desktop browsers is pretty good. It's a bit slower on mobile (but acceptable for my purpose).

`sgp4` has some C-bindings, so I had to compile to WebAssembly using `Emscripten`, and made a `.whl` (wheel). `skyfield` is pure python, so I made a wheel for that as well using `python -m build`.

It all works surprisingly well.
