Published the first version of the Dropbox-based blog that gets mirrored on S3.

The [GitHub project](https://github.com/cmdr2/blog-agent) is live, and still has quite a few bugs and missing pieces.

## How does it work?

It takes the original posts from Dropbox and automatically publishes them in other places (after formatting them). As the author of those notes, the only place I'm concerned about is my Dropbox folder with my text files. But the agent then goes and mirrors the writing in different places automatically, and I never need to think about that process at all.

I wrote this post on my phone, using the Dropbox app and text editor. All I need to do is save this text file, and it's live. There's something interesting about that.
