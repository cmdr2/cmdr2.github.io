Updated the flat_blog generator, and modified the blog-agent to use Dropbox Refresh tokens to get new auth tokens.

Also made it auto-generate an index.html, and added styling for the list of posts. The idea is to make it look a bit more like a twitter feed, and less like a list of links. Still not fully there yet.
