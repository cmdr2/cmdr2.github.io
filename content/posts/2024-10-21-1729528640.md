Finished the blog-agent project for now. The blog is now [live](https://cmdr2.org), and the code is up at the [GitHub project](https://github.com/cmdr2/blog-agent).

In summary, it lets me write my notes as text files in Dropbox, and it automatically formats and publishes it as a blog on S3. It runs by triggering an AWS Lambda function via a Dropbox webhook.

It's built purely for a [workflow](https://cmdr2.github.io/notes/2024/10/a10fe4e53771e975.html) that I'm very used to (writing notes in text files, one file per month, posts separated by two hyphens padded with line breaks). But making this a public project will probably force me to keep things well-documented (so that I can fix things easily, if they break in the future).

Added the ability to auto-generate an `atom.xml` (for feeds), and auto-generate a Twitter feed-like `index.html` (with pagination).

It currently uses a custom hacky static-site generator (in Python), but it would be better to make this a wrapper around Hugo (and to move the Lambda runtime to OS/Go). That'll help improve the customizability, performance, and robustness.
