Following up on [yesterday's post](https://cmdr2.github.io/notes/2024/11/1731068793/), there's now full automation for the conversion of provisional NORAD IDs to the official one (once they're available in Celestrak). ~~This automation is still waiting to be deployed, because it needs to be tested with the official NORAD IDs for yesterday's Starlink launch (G6-77), once they're assigned next week.~~ This automation has been now been deployed.

So now, the only processes still done manually are (a) selecting a new leader for a train, if the current leader drifts away from the train, and (b) removing old trains that have spread out completely.
