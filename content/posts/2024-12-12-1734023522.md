Freebird is finally out on sale - [https://freebirdxr.com/buy](https://freebirdxr.com/buy)

It's still called an *Early Access* version, since it needs more work to feel like a cohesive product. It's already got quite a lot of features, and it's definitely useful. But I think it's still missing a few key features, and needs an overall "fine-tuning" of the user experience and interface.

So yeah, lots more to do. But it feels good to get something out on sale after nearly 4 years of development. Freebird has already spent 2 years in free public beta, so quite a number of people have already used it.

Freebird sold its first few copies since it went on sale last night. The main emotion is a sense of relief I think.
