Built two experiments using locally-hosted LLMs. One is a script that lets two bots chat with each other endlessly. The other is a browser bookmarklet that summarizes the selected text in 300 words or less.

Both use an OpenAI-compatible API, so they can be pointed at regular OpenAI-compatible remote servers, or your own locally-hosted servers (like LMStudio).

* [Summarize Bookmarklet](https://github.com/cmdr2/study/blob/main/ml/summarize-bookmarklet.js)

The bot chat script is interesting, but the conversation starts stagnating/repeating after 20-30 messages. The conversation is definitely very interesting initially. The script lets you define the names and descriptions of the two bots, the scene description, and the first message by the first bot. After that, it lets the two bots talk to each other endlessly.

The browser bookmarklet is very useful, but many sites have domain restrictions (even if my server allows CORS). So it's a bit hit-or-miss.
