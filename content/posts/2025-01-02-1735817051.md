Really need to figure out a way to render standard HTML elements (styled with CSS and modified with JS) in a 3D scene. Reinventing excellent libraries like PrimeVue again inside 3D (for rendering in VR) is just wasteful.

There have been attempts, e.g. A-Frame, but we really need to view the webpage in 3D. Just regular HTML elements. The regular DOM renderer. The pieces feel like they're there conceptually, but the implementation gap is probably big enough (that it hasn't happened yet).

For e.g. Freebird (Blender VR plugin) had to reinvent everything from scratch - UI buttons were rectangles drawn using shaders, grid layouts had to be reimplemented from scratch. I abstracted it into a sensible framework (heavily mimicking HTML/CSS/JS, because it makes sense!). But obviously this is all very wasteful, and results in poor quality UIs, because building a UI framework isn't the primary focus of Freebird (it's 3D modeling in VR).
