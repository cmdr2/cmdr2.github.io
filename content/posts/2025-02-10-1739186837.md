// Cross-posted from [Easy Diffusion's blog](https://easydiffusion.github.io/blog/1739186837).

Easy Diffusion (and `sdkit`) now also support AMD on Windows automatically (using DirectML), thanks to integrating with [torchruntime](https://github.com/easydiffusion/torchruntime/). It also supports integrated GPUs (Intel and AMD) on Windows, making Easy Diffusion faster on PCs without dedicated graphics cards.
