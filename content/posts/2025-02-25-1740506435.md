Added support for `float16` ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV operations in the CUDA backend of ggml. Also fixed the CPU implementation of these operations in float16 to work with repeating tensors, and added test cases. PR: [https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/pull/1121](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/pull/1121)

Discussed making [ggml-cpu.c](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/c21d976febcc75bcc487e4a2e4074b488f829553/src/ggml-cpu/ggml-cpu.c) into a C++ file, so that we can use function templates to de-duplicate a huge amount of code in that file.

Also worked on adding `float16` support (in CUDA and CPU) for a number of unary operators, like `SQRT`, `RELU`, `GELU`, `SIGMOID`, `LOG`, `COS`, `CLAMP` etc. It seems to be passing the tests, so will propose this as a PR soon.
