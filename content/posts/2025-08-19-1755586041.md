Migrated cmdr2.org to GitHub Pages (with Hugo). This replaces my custom static-site generator.

Added a `#worklog` tag filter on my blog, so that I can start posting worklogs without worrying about spamming the main feed.

Updated [blog-agent](https://github.com/cmdr2/blog-agent) to work with multiple publish destinations and projects, e.g. publishing Easy Diffusion-related posts to ED's github repo etc.
