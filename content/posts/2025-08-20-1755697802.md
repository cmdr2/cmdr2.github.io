**Edit**: This script has been replaced by [GitHub Actions Wizard] (https://github.com/cmdr2/github-actions-wizard) 

Wrote a simple utility script for quickly setting up deployments to S3 or Lambda via a GitHub Action. Gist: [https://gist.github.com/cmdr2/7261109b0e214942f1c7864024a6daa1](https://gist.github.com/cmdr2/7261109b0e214942f1c7864024a6daa1)

It'll create the required IAM Role and Policy automatically, and generate a workflow yaml inside your git repository.

Run `github-deploy-setup` inside your git repository.
