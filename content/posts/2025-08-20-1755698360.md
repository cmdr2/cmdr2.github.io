Finished setting up multi-project outputs in [blog-agent](https://github.com/cmdr2/blog-agent). I can now write posts and worklogs using my long-standing setup (plain text files in my Dropbox folder, rolled-over monthly), and blog-agent will publish them on their respective project blogs based on the tags.

Posts tagged with `#freebird` will get posted on [Freebird's blog](https://freebirdxr.com/blog). And posts tagged with `#easydiffusion` or `#sdkit` will get posted on [Easy Diffusion's blog](https://easydiffusion.github.io/blog).

Everything will also get cross-posted on my [personal blog](https://cmdr2.github.io).
