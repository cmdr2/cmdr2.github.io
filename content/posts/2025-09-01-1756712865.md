Puppetry v1.2.19 released! It allows you to move the overall armature rig via an external animation, while still controlling the head and hands with the VR controllers. Previously, the head and hands would stay at a fixed place in the world, and not move along with the rig.

For e.g. this is useful if you want to move the character down a corridor (using a script or animation timeline), while using Puppetry's motion capture to animate the head and hands.

Puppetry v1.2.19 also adds sensible offset defaults if Rigify bones are attached, specifically the `head`, `hand_ik.R` and `hand_ik.L` bones. This will help animate these bones in a more comfortable orientation.
