# sat-timings library released

Released [sat-timings](https://github.com/findstarlink/sat-timings), a Javascript library for predicting the visibility timings and path of satellites (e.g., Starlink) for a given location and time.



This library powers [findstarlink.com](https://findstarlink.com) and has served millions of satellite visibility predictions over the past 6 years.



It runs entirely in Javascript, and predicts the optimal time to see a given list of satellites in the night sky.
