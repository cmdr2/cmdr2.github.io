[Freebird](https://freebirdxr.com) v2.2.0 released - Freebird now exposes the VR headset and controller positions via three empty objects in the scene: FB-Headset, FB-Controller-Right, and FB-Controller-Left.

These three empties live-track the position of the headset and the VR controllers. For e.g. you can attach objects to these empties to animate objects or bones.
