// Cross-posted from [Freebird's blog](https://freebirdxr.com/blog/2025/10/03/1759468000).

Freebird v2.2.2 released. It now exposes the states/values of the VR buttons (as custom properties) in `FB-Controller-Right` and `FB-Controller-Left` (see: [XR Tracking Objects](https://freebirdxr.com/docs/xr-tracking-objects/)).

These values will be updated every frame, when VR is running.

You can use these properties to drive shapekeys, or use them in other scripts:
* To drive a shapekey, please right-click a property, e.g. 'trigger', and click `Copy as New Driver`. Then right-click on your shapekey value, and select `Paste Driver`.
* To use in a script, use the custom property directly. E.g. `bpy.data.objects["FB-Controller-Right"]["trigger"]`
