Great post on why a "work-in-progress" notes blog is useful - [https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/)

This is exactly why I (re)started this blog. This blog is mainly a way to share the notes that I take when working on problems. I've always written huge volumes of notes (privately) when working through problems, but making them public has forced me to:
1. Work through them with more rigor and detail (since they'll be public).
2. Structure them better.
3. Catch and fix biases.
4. Tackle large topics through a series of posts over time.
5. Write them in a way that I can revisit later on and remember what I was thinking (instead of a giant messy blob of notes).

It is important though to avoid the trap of feeling productive by publishing notes, instead of finally "shipping" the actual thing that you were meant to finish.
