Collecting the worklog over the past 2 weeks.

- Added the ability to add and edit `Text` objects in Freebird while inside VR. This is useful for adding notes and labels while working in VR - [https://x.com/freebirdxr/status/2004091164946059451](https://x.com/freebirdxr/status/2004091164946059451)

- Added a "Camera Preview" feature in Puppetry, to allow the user to see the live view from the scene Camera, while recording. This is helpful in avoiding surprises after recording, for e.g. realizing that the movements weren't captured correctly by the scene Camera.

- Fixed compatibility issues with Blender 5.0. Specifically around the change in Blender's API for Pose Bone selection.

- Filed a bug report for Blender 5.0.1, for a regression where draw handlers in XR cause Blender to crash - [https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/152071](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/152071)

- Added weekly automated tests for Freebird against the latest available version of Blender. This will help catch issues with new Blender versions proactively without relying on user complaints.
