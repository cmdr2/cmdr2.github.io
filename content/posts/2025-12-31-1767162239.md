// Cross-posted from [Freebird's blog](https://freebirdxr.com/blog/2025/12/31/1767162239).

Combining the worklogs for a few days.

- Worked on testing Freebird and Puppetry with the new XR API changes coming in Blender 5.1 (related to making `navigation_scale` read-only). Continuing to discuss and give feedback to Blender devs on their `#xr` chat channel.
- Investigated why grease pencil strokes render incorrectly in VR, by digging into Blender's source for that. Haven't found the reason/fix yet. It seems related to [draw_grease_pencil_lib.glsl](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/commit/4bfd728b797ed298ec66f6e57a372b4fb1d28516/source/blender/draw/intern/shaders/draw_grease_pencil_lib.glsl#L234), possibly `drw_modelmat()`, since `winmat` and `viewport_res` don't change when we change `xr_session_state.navigation_scale` or `xr_session_settings.base_scale`.
- Added the ability to set the location of the camera preview in Puppetry.
- Submitted a fix for the regression introduced in Blender 5.0.1 (causes Blender to crash when Freebird or Puppetry are started) - [https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/152237](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/152237)
