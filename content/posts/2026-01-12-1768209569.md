// Cross-posted from [Freebird's blog](https://freebirdxr.com/blog/2026/01/12/1768209569).

Freebird v2.6.0 released. Changes since the last blog post (v2.2.2):
- Adds the ability to add and edit `Text` while inside VR. This is useful for labeling and making notes inside VR, without having to sketch notes by hand.
- Adds support for Vulkan and Blender 5.
- Shows the scene scale in the controller's panel (below the main menu). This will let you know the zoom level of the scene, for e.g. 1:1 or 1:10 or 15:1, so that you can plan accordingly when working with real-world units.
