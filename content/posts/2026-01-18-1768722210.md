// Cross-posted from [Easy Diffusion's blog](https://easydiffusion.github.io/blog/1768722210).

Started the long-pending rewrite of Easy Diffusion's server code. v4 intends to replace the Python (and PyTorch) based server with a simple C++ version. The reason for rewriting the server in C++ is to achieve sub-second startup time for the UI, and to reduce the download size (won't need to distribute Python along with Easy Diffusion) or mess with conda/venv etc. And it's also something that I want to do for personal taste, i.e. de-bloating what doesn't need to be bloated.

This will also simplify the fairly messy internals and design of Easy Diffusion, which has grown organically over the years. The core of Easy Diffusion doesn't need a lot, and I plan on moving out some of the parts into server-side plugins (e.g. Cloudflare tunnels, model merging etc). v4 intends to have a clear API for plugins (on the UI side as well as on the server).
